# Kaggle: [Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 - Load Forecasting](www.kaggle.com/c/global-energy-forecasting-competition-2012-load-forecasting)

> A hierarchical load forecasting problem: backcasting and forecasting hourly loads (in kW) for a US utility with 20 zones.

The competition has been closed and one of the winner's solution is described here, [A gradient boosting approach to the Kaggle load forecasting competition](https://robjhyndman.com/papers/kaggle-competition.pdf).

In this repo, following how the winner proceeded the task, I will try to gain more insights and better understanding of machine learning, especially timeseries forecasting.
